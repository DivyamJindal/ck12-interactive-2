# Pi Interactive Learning Tool

This is an interactive web application designed to help students learn about Pi (π) in a fun, visual, and engaging way. The application features a cartoonish circle that students can unfold to visualize the relationship between a circle's diameter and its circumference, demonstrating the concept of Pi.

## Features

- Interactive circle with a friendly face that students can click on or use buttons to interact with
- Visual demonstration of how Pi represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter
- Simple, colorful, and cartoonish design appealing to students
- Responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- Clear explanations of what Pi is and its approximate value

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser
2. Click on the circle or the "Unfold Circle" button to see the demonstration
3. The circle will unfold to show how the circumference stretches out to approximately 3.14 times the diameter
4. Click "Fold Back" to return to the original circle

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that structures the content
- `styles.css` - Contains all the styling for the interactive
- `script.js` - Contains the JavaScript code that makes the interactive work

## Educational Value

This interactive helps students understand:
- What Pi (π) is
- That Pi is approximately 3.14
- The relationship between a circle's diameter and circumference
- The formula: π = Circumference ÷ Diameter

The visual nature of the interactive makes the abstract concept of Pi more concrete and easier to grasp for students.
